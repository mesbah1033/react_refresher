# Completing the course found at [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations/getting-started-with-react)


- creating this repo to track my progress
- going to be using this as a refresher for myself
- used parcel to "display" index.html file till index_7b.html
- I used index_(number) to add comments to the specific progression made in the course.
- From Chapter 8 onwards, the course starts using index.js/page.js instead of index.html
